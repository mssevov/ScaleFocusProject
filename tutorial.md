# Introduction
**Welcome to Code Breakers!**

You can either play alone with *a bot* or together with *another player*.
<br>
The goal of the game is to guess a code that the other player/bot has made up. 
<br>
The code is 4 symbols long and you have 13 attempts to guess it.

# Controls and Mechanics

A rule is turned off, if it is coloured red.

## Player 1's turn / Bot's turn

If you have chosen to play against another player, they must first write the code. You mustn't watch while it's the other player's turn. Be patient.

If you have chosen to play against a bot, it will automatically write the code.

## Player 2's turn

After the codee has been chosen, it's your turn to guess it. Write your guess, but bewarem as you have only 13 attempts to figure out the combination. After 13 failed attempts, you lose and player 1/the bot win.
